This repository is dedicated to students and professionals who would like to brush up and advance their SQL skills for their careers. I found (https://www.sql-practice.com) educational and the web site user friendly however there wasnâ€™t the complete solution book shared on the web site neither on GitHub. So now you can get the answers with alternative solutions for each question 

The test contains 53 questions and consists of 3 category:

You can use the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to figure out what data to store, the entities, their attributes and also how entities relate to other entities.
